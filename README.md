docker-compose up ( TODO, on change, as is, add --build)

- (TODO expects a local adjacent private repo folder /stuff//input//output)
-- (how to guarantee data isn't moved from priv to here here)
Works:
- qdrant docs @ http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/welcome
- alpine-http file server @ http://localhost:8081/
- nginx index.html served @ http://localhost:8082/
- ollama @ http://localhost:11434/
- open web ui @ localhost:3000 

So far so good. TODO, clean all docker bits except images...time test. test101 

Then a nuke repull time test.
