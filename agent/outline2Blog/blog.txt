Determining the best data structure for a task: lists versus objects.
Avoid using objects merely for aesthetics; lists should be your first choice when appropriate.
Lengthy, well-structured sentences are preferable to dealing with complex, nested objects and redundant keys; after all, legibility matters.
Be cautious of relying solely on lists; there are situations where lists may not be the best option.
The takeaway here is selecting the appropriate data structure for your task.
Use a list when a straightforward arrangement of items is necessary, and opt for objects when dealing with more complex, hierarchical relationships.
Keep the tone concise, informative, and lighthearted.
